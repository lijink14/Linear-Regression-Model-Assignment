## General Information
- The objective of this project was to build a model to predict the demand for shared bikes.
- The background involves understanding the factors that influence bike-sharing demand, especially in the context of a bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, which faced revenue dips due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The project aims to solve the business problem of predicting bike demand post-quarantine to help BoomBikes in strategic planning and meeting customer expectations.
- The dataset used includes daily counts of bike rentals and several independent variables like weather conditions, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and seasonal information.

## Conclusions
- The model demonstrates a good fit, with an R-squared value of approximately 0.808, indicating that it explains a significant portion of the variance in bike rental counts.
- Key factors influencing bike rentals include temperature, year, and season, as indicated by their statistical significance and VIF values.
- The exclusion of multicollinear variables improved the model's predictive capability and interpretability.
- The model's insights can guide BoomBikes in resource allocation and marketing strategies to optimize bike availability and increase rentals.
